# Writing Utensil Teacher AI
This project can detect five different kinds of writing utensils, which are pencils, pens, pencil cases, pencil sharpeners, and rulers. This project is helpful to young students in familiarizing with the names of the writing utensils as well as ways to strategically use it in a classroom. As I remember when I was growing up, not many students could fully, correctly use the writing utensils in the classroom. That's why I created this project so that all students can equally learn how what these utensils are and how to properly use them. 

## The Algorithm
The network used in this project is ImageNet(resnet-18). How this network works is when you give the network an image of an object, it makes a guess on what the object might be with a percentage of how accurate it thinks its guess is.
